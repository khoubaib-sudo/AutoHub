This repository hosts a fully functional Next.js 13 application that brings the future of car rental. With a tech stack comprising React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, the RapidAPI Cars API, and Car Images API.

In the process of crafting this cutting-edge application, I learned to:

Navigate the ins and outs of Next.js 13 App Router and harness the power of server-side rendering for an unparalleled user experience.
Implement an advanced search functionality that empowers users to locate their dream cars with ease.
Develop filtering capabilities that streamline the car selection process.
Design custom filter, combo box, and modal elements, enhancing the application's usability.
Maintain a well-organized file and folder structure that reflects clean code principles.
